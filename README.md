# disser_app
This is the repository with data and code to create Shiny application that allows looking at the results of my Master thesis and making some fun simulations. 

To activate the application run runGitHub("disser_app","terabitiya") in your R Studio because I can't host it yet.

The key idea of this research is pretty simple. Previous scholars supposed that a voter deciding what political party to choose takes into account all the parties participating in campaign. However, it's not true. He or she has its own effective choice set. 

The model that is used in this research allows us to simulate the situation when a voter has some consideration set that we can create artificially. It is really appropriate to the Russian political system with restricted number of parties and dominating party "United Russia".

So, to see how voters will behave conditioned on artificially created consideration sets try the application!
